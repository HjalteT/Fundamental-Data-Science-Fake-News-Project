# Fundamental-Data-Science-Fake-News-Project

To run the code certain files are necessary to be inside of the folder of the files.
These files are:

"news_sample.csv", 

"995,000_rows.csv" and the scraped articles from bbc/news.

Note that the code has a line which writes the large data set into a new CSV file of roughly 3GB.

Otherwise since it is a notebook file (ipynb), all that is needed to run the code is to click "run all"
